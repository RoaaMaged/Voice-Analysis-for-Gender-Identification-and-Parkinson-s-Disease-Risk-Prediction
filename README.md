# Voice-Analysis-for-Gender-Identification-and-Parkinson-Disease-Risk-Prediction
This project introduces two innovative machine learning models leveraging voice analysis for gender identification and Parkinson’s disease risk prediction. Utilizing extensive datasets of voice recordings, this paper explores the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in analyzing acoustic features for medical diagnostics. The models demonstrate high accuracy, robustness, and potential for clinical applications, providing a non-invasive and efficient tool for medical professionals.

Performance Metrics for gender recognition model: 
Accuracy: 
The SVM model achieved an accuracy of 92%, while the Neural Network reached 95%, and the KNN model showed an 89% accuracy rate.
Precision and Recall: 
Precision and recall rates were also high, reflecting the models' effectiveness in correctly identifying gender from voice samples.

Model Performance for Parkinson disease recognition:
Accuracy: 
For Parkinson's disease prediction, the SVM model achieved 90% accuracy, the Neural Network was slightly better at 93%, and KNN lagged slightly at 87%.
Sensitivity and Specificity: 
Both sensitivity and specificity metrics were robust, indicating the models' ability to accurately identify patients with Parkinson’s disease.
